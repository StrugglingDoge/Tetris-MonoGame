# Game Modes
## Survival
- ### Survival is the classic Tetris mode you've come to love. In this mode, your main objective is to stay alive as long as possible while continuing to reach higher and higher levels.

## Time Trial
- ### In Time Trial, your main objective is to get the highest score/highest amount of cleared lines within a 3 minute time limit. Once time has run out the game will end, so act quick!
    
## 40 Line
- ### In this mode, your main objective is to complete 40 lines in the shortest amount of time, or even with the highest score.
    
## Hardcore
- ### Hardcore is for veteran players looking for more of a challenge. In this mode, you are unable to hold tetriminoes, meaning no saftey net! The main objective is to aim for Tetrises and T-spin's as getting double and triple lines will punish you with garbage rows.
    
## Classic
- ### Classic mode attempts to recreate the feel of NES Tetris by changing the following gameplay features: Disabling the ability to hold tetriminoes & use hard drop, and along with those changes, it also implements a custom gravity interval to recreate the feeling of gravity in NES Tetris.
    
**All modes include a explanation on the game preferences page**
